# Participate in the Totemancer Raffle on TON Blockchain!

Welcome to the Totemancer Raffle! We're thrilled to bring a fair mint fest to the TON community. As we finalize preparations for our game launch on the mainnet, we're offering exclusive early-adopter Totemancer NFTs. This event is an opportunity to get involved early and support our development. Funds raised will be allocated as follows: 70% for the play-to-earn pool, 20% for referrals, and 10% for game developers.

## Ensuring Fairness

To guarantee fairness, we've published the source code of our raffle script for public verification. The giveaway will use the last incoming transaction hash from the blockchain at the event's conclusion as the seed. Simple and transparent!

2. Tap the "Minting Fest" button.
3. Connect your wallet.
4. Accept the prepared transaction of 0.25 TON.
